## Full Stack Django Engineering Challenge

## Running This Service

The backend service can be started by running `python src/manage.py runserver`. It will be available at localhost:8000/form/.

The submittend forms can be viewed at http://localhost:8000/form/submissions

### Requirements

This service runs using Python 3.10. You can install all requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests by running `python -m unittest discover -s test -v`


### Task

Using the Django Framework:

1. Create a multipart form wizard which collects the following data:
   1. Title
   2. First Name
   3. Surname
   4. Date of Birth
   5. Company Name
   6. Address
   7. Telephone
   8. Bidding Settings (choose one)
      1. HIGH
      2. MEDIUM
      3. LOW
   9. Google Ads Account ID


2. Collect the data and insert into a database as a single entity.


3. Add validation.
   1. Only over 18s can complete this form
   2. Unknown bidding settings should not be allowed to be submitted
   3. Any other validation you think is required.


4. Develop an HTML template to show applications which have been submitted and a way for them to be deleted.


### Bonus

We really value neatness and things being put in place to aid local development and continuous integration.

Needless to say, we like tests.

Hooking up some authentication into the app would be nice.

Making it look nice with a UI framework such as Twitter Bootstrap.
